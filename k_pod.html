        <h3>Client Info</h3>
        <p>The product given to me by my classmate Jake Cuason was Keurig K Pods for a fictional company called SeaSips express.</p>
        <h5>Initial Client Brief</h5>
        <div class="grid">

            </a>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>From the spec sheet given, Jake mistook the assignment as a redesign for an existing company, which he chose to be Starbucks. However, due to copyright law, his original spec sheet was not up to par.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h5>Reversion of Spec Sheet</h5>
        <div class="grid">

          </div>
          <div>
            <p>Upon receiving Jake's revised spec sheet, I was able to quickly develop a rough theme for the project.</p>
            <p>By visiting several stores, I gained valuable insights into market trends and consumer preferences.</p> 
          </div>

        </div>
        <p class="below_img">Jake thankfully provided additional client information, including his preference for a Disney character in the product design. He suggested Grandmamah, the kraken from "Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken," which would have added a sea-themed aesthetic. Unfortunately, Disney's copyright restrictions prevented me from using that character in a real-world scenario. To honor Jake's request, I incorporated a kraken element into the logo design.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>I opted for a simpler business card design compared to my previous one. The reason being I felt that it needed to present a sense of professionalism. I wanted this card to be presented to big-name companies and represent the company to be clean, straightforward, and effective like the coffee products.</p>

          </div>
          <div>
            <p>Initially, I considered a sea-themed design to align with the company name. However, the primary colors and the kraken incorporation proved to be ineffective for a standout coffee product design. This made it challenging to create a design that I was proud to send to the client.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h5 class="below_img">Final Package Design</h5>
        <div class="grid">
          <div>
            <p>After time and some considering and falling short of ideas I decided to consult Stephen, our instructor. In this meeting clear guidance was provided on the specific application of the primary colors, clarifying that they were intended solely for the company logo. Moreover, it was emphasized that the essence of the project lay more in photo manipulation. Insights were shared on salvaging elements from the initial design. Armed with clarity and a new direction, I embarked on a comprehensive redesign of the k-pod package. The result was a design that not only met my own standards but also aligned more closely with the client's needs and expectations.</p>

        <p class="below_img">The final design took a more minimalist approach, with a focus on clean lines and a modern look that would appeal to the target market. The color palette was simplified to ensure the product stood out on shelves while still maintaining a connection to the sea theme through the logo and subtle design elements. The kraken logo became the centerpiece of the brand identity, symbolizing the strength and depth of flavor in SeaSips Express Coffee.</p>
        <p>The logo on the cup shows that SeaSips express Coffee is drank in coffee shop referring it a high quality product</p>
        <p>The Octopus on the left side of the box goes well with SeaSips Express' motto Which is <q>Sip, Multitask, Indulge</q>.</p>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>This project taught me the importance of adaptability in design, especially when working with client specifications in a simulated real-world scenario. It helped me develop a solution that met the client's requirements and reflected the brand's identity. The final product design not only fulfilled the project requirements but also provided valuable experience in overcoming design challenges by seeking help from others and effectively managing my time to meet deadlines.</p>
