        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>Our group created fictional companies: Alpine Armour, an outdoor apparel company, and Marmot Media, a marketing agency. We took over the roles in Marmot Media, where our group was commissioned to lead a promotion event for Alpine Armour's new "Alta Jacket" release. The campaign focused on a <span class="green_no_bold">Black Friday launch</span> with a <span class="highlight_text">ski workshop giveaway</span>, leveraging social media and the Alpine Armour website to gain brand awareness throughout the submission phase. The primary goals of the campaign was to boost brand awareness, drive sales, and grow the Alpine Armour community.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Research & Development</h3>
        <p>Jayden and I came up with the bare bones of the project, however, some refinements were made to suit instructor feedback. Before any planning of any event we need to come up with the goals and objectives of the campaign. Doing research we came up with.</p>

        <div class="line_break"></div>
        <h5>Goals & Objectives</h5>
        <details>
          <summary role="button">Increase Brand Awareness by 25% through Alpine Armour Social Networks</summary>
          <p>As the most obvious goal in an apparel company is to boost their sales in each quarter. We decided it was best to increase brand awareness instead because...</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Customer Retention - Storytelling is a powerful tool for transforming potential customers into loyal ones.By consistently sharing Alpine Armour's commitment to sustainable practices, we can build a strong brand reputation that resonates with environmentally conscious consumers and fosters a dedicated community of Alpine Armour enthusiasts.</li>
            <li>Reputation Management - Strong brands have a greater ability to rebuild their reputation when setbacks occur. Take Toyota, for example. Despite the 2023 recall of their Tundra and Tacoma trucks due to a rear axle manufacturing defect, the brand's reputation for reliability remained largely intact. By swiftly issuing a recall and offering exceptional customer service, Toyota reinforced its commitment to quality and safety, preserving the trust and loyalty of its customers.</li>
          </ul>
          
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary role="button">Boost Alpine Armour Sales by 25% during the giveaway period.</summary>
          <p>Back to the obvious goal of boosting sales. I've come up with a way to increase the sales of the jacket</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pre Orders of the Jacket will increase the amount of submissions compared to the actual release date of the jacket.</li>
          </ul>
        </details>

        <p>After establishing our goals and objectives we set out to refine the workings of the event. Doing a competitive analysis of dominate figures in the outdoor apparel marketing. We were both inspiration from Arc'teryx's Backcountry Academy. We figured that instead of heavy focus on advanced skiers we choose to <span class="highlight_text">target the everyday individuals.</span></p>
        <p>The reasoning being, is that targeting to a larger demographic will provide a more broader potential customer base as it correlates to word-of-mouth marketing as it will satisfy our goal of boosting brand awareness.</p>

        <div class="line_break"></div>
        <h5>Timing</h5>
        <p>From knowledge and research, we determined that the best time to release a product is during the holiday season due to the trend of increased spending. Therefore, we decided to release the new jacket on Black Friday.</p>
        <p>But you're probably asking when the giveaway will start and end. We came up with the dates from September 15 to November 30. This will allow about two and a half months for entry submissions and pre-orders for the new Alta Jacket. This will not only allow us time to increase brand awareness but also boost sales before the jacket even releases.</p>

            </a>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>Outdoor enthusiasts and casual weekend warriors are prime targets for the Alta jacket due to their active lifestyles and high praise for high-quality outdoor gear. Word-of-mouth marketing is a powerful tool for reaching specific niches within the demographic, and building trust within these groups is essential for a successful campaign.</p>
            <!-- <p>Having Ryan Reynolds as an influencer can help us reach our target audience and create a sense of trust and accountability. As a likeable figure in the Hollywood scene, Ryan Reynolds can help us connect with the outside target demographic by promoting the Alta jacket's features and benefits.</p> -->
            <p>Given the concern about climate change, environmentally conscious consumers are going to appreciate the Alta jacket's use of 95% recycled materials.</p>

        <!-- to do  -->
        <details>
          <summary role="button">Overview</summary>
          <p>Marmot Media will host a giveaway event to promote Alpine Armour's new "Alta Jacket" on Black Friday weekend. The grand prize is an all-expenses-paid ski workshop for four, complete with new mountain equipment and Alpine Armour apparel. Additionally, Ryan Reynolds and an Olympic skier will co-host a ski workshop in Whistler to demonstrate the jacket's capabilities in challenging conditions. The giveaway contest will run from September 15 to November 30. It will benefit Alpine Armour in three ways: increased brand awareness, boosted Alta Jacket sales, and expanded email newsletter subscribers. Ryan Reynolds will also promote the event on his social media channels. Contestants can enter the giveaway on social media and the Alpine Armour website. On social media, they can like, tag, and share posts to earn entries. On the website, they can sign up for the email newsletter and create an account to receive additional entries. We aim to achieve 1,000 shares, 5,000 likes, and 2,500 tagged friends on Instagram, as well as 2,500 new account website sign-ups. Our sales goals are a 25% increase during the giveaway period and a 50% increase on Black Friday weekend.</p>

          <h5>Conclusion</h5>
          <p>Although this marketing campaign was fictional, it proved to be a vital learning curve. It taught me to think about every single asset that goes into a marketing campaign, especially an event. Things like the budget, goals, and even the giveaway itself proved to be a challenge, not only the idea but also the execution of the promotional event. However, it was fun to come up with all the ideas as a skier myself would love the idea of a ski workshop giveaway.</p>
